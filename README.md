# Simple-MACD-Cross-Autotrader

MetaTrader 4 - MACD Cross Automatic Trading Robot


Works only on higher time frames.

This is a good manual system to trade, but not as good in automated form.

The idea is to place pending trades on the highest or lowest fractal preceeding the cross of the MACD above or below 0

Bot currently doesn't deal with ranges as well but would benefit from manual supervision.
